I'm an evolutionary behavioural ecologist - which is quite a mouthful, but reflects my interests in how the evolutionary and ecological processes shape different behaviours. I'm particularly interested in the reproductive and social behaviours, and I have been working primarily on birds.

I'm currently doing my PhD at the University of Edinburgh working on the superb fairy-wren (*Malurus cyaneus*) under the supervision of Prof Loeske Kruuk, Prof Andrew Cockburn (both based at the Australian National University) and Dr Craig Walling. The main focus of my project is to explore **the dynamics of inbreeding and infidelity**, investigating **context-dependent mate choice** and the effects of **the social environment** in this cooperative breeder. Most of my time is spent working with a long-term dataset and modeling in R, however I also carry out fieldwork investigating the interactions between fairy-wren mothers and their sons in the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra.

Before my PhD I did an Animal Behaviour MBiolSci (BSc + integrated masters year) at the University of Sheffield, graduating with 1st-Class Honours. In my masters year I undertook an extended research project under the supervision of Prof Tim Birkhead and Dr Nicola Hemmings, focusing on **the mechanisms of sperm storage in avian female reproductive tract**, using zebra finch (*Taeniopygia guttata*) and quail (*Coturnix japonica*) as study organisms.

During my undergraduate degree I secured independent funding from the British Ecological Society and the Genetics Society to conduct two summer research projects: one on **the phenotypic plasticity and chitin allocation in *Daphnia*** in Dr Andrew Beckermanâ€™s lab, where I developed protocols for *Daphnia* head and gut isolation, embedding, sectioning and staining; and the other on **the genetic basis of Seychelles warbler (*Acrocephalus sechellensis*) personalities** (with Dr Hannah Dugdale), where I investigated the associations between SNPs in two candidate genes (DRD4 and SERT) and the bold and exploratory behaviours in the warblers. The latter project has resulted in a publication, which you can find [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138439).

In the final year of my BSc I also carried out a project on **foraging decisions in free-living mallards** (with Prof Ben Hatchwell) and did my dissertation on **the consequences of animal personalities** (under Dr Fiona Hunter).
