# Current Research

My PhD focuses on the evolution of mating patterns through an investigation of the dynamics of inbreeding & infidelity, and their potential interactions with the social environment, in a cooperatively breeding species. I use multi-generational pedigree data from a wild population of superb fairy-wrens (Malurus cyaneus), to examine the causes and magnitude of inbreeding and inbreeding depression, and to investigate explanations of infidelity, as understanding of those topics is still limited.
