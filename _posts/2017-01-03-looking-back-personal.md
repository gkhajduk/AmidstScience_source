I'm glad I did this: looking back **I actually managed to do a very decent amount of stuff**. During the year quite a few times it felt like I was just failing miserably at all of it: falling asleep trying to read, spending more time waiting for the paint to dry (literally!) than actually painting, doing more planning for a trip than travelling and so on.

I think it's because I was looking at different areas in isolation. Reading one book per month doesn't seem like much, *but* reading one book **AND** completing one painting **AND** writing one blog post **AND** (...) per month isn't too shabby :] 

I'd encourage you to try it! Let me know how it goes. I also did a [work version]({% post_url 2017-01-07-looking-back-work %}) of this post.

So what did I do over 2016? I learned a bunch of new skills and accomplished a few more, but it wasn't all wine and cheese. Have a look:

### I have learned a few new things

- I have finally managed to tackle my fear of water and inability to float and I have **learned how to swim** (or rather how not to drown straight away!)
- ...which allowed me to learn how to **scuba dive** and get **certified** (did PADI Open Water and Adventure).
- I played a bit more with **coding** outside of work and R; and (after messing around with other things) I **built this website** with Jekyll.
- I started to learn **photography** and (together with my partner) bought my first DSLR. We now need to figure out how to process all those thousands of photos we took on our trip to Queensland.
- I have been learning **watercolour painting**. I completed **8 paintings** (i.e. one per month) through Anna Mason's watercolour school and have others started, one of which is nearly completed (one more session needed I think). I have also painted a gift for my dear friend and did some smaller pieces/sketchbook work. This is my clematis and viola from the School:

### Other things I have accomplished

- **I read 8 books** and I am just short of finishing further 4 (damn! shouldn't be reading multiple books at once). I read tons of blogs and articles (and stuff connected to work), but I have been struggling with finishing novels. It's partially because I'm one of those annoying people who fall asleep as soon as they crawl into bed. The best book I have read last year was *"The Girl With All The Gifts"* by M. R. Carey. 
- I added quite a few **new species to my birding list**, including the Queensland endemics except for the owls and the cassowary you can see below.
- Talking about QLD: I went to the tropics, visited the oldest rainforest in the world and saw the Great Barrier Reef. Pretty great trip!
- **I published 12 blog posts** and started a [Fieldwork Tips]({% post_url 2016-09-26-fieldwork-tips-series %}) series (more to come on that front).
- I managed to **keep evenings and weekends work free** with very, very few exceptions - yay me!
- I made **more effort on the social side**. I also managed to see some of my college friends, which is always a treat. And I met a few of the great Twitter folk at a conference. 
- I sorted most of my belonging out and **de-cluttered** considerably. *Refuse, Reduce, Reuse & Repair, Repurpose, Recycle* - right?
- Over **5 years with my awesome partner**, including 2 years of long-distance relationship, since I have moved for my PhD. Tackling the two body problem isn't easy, but we are both committed to each other and to making it work.

### Oddball items
 
- I got **stung by a jellyfish**, which I'm adding to being stung by a scorpion and by bulldog ants. Lets hope that a stingray isn't next.
- **I unleashed [#wildbum](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23wildbum)** on the world *and it was good* - [my claim to Twitter fame]({% post_url 2016-02-12-we-created-monster-wildbum-monster %})!

### Low Points

What gave? I want to focus on positives, but I don't want to pretend that it all has been rosy. 

I have had **more health issues** this year - in addition to my standard mix of chronic and recurring problems. This made life that little more difficult and more painful. That, combined with limited time and access issues, meant that I pretty much stopped rock climbing. Which in turn meant that it was very hard to get enough physio and keep my chronic pain in check... A vicious circle.

Not climbing regularly = less social contact. Needing to do more physio at home = even less social contact. Dealing with two body problem means that I already struggle to be a part of social circles, so this hasn't helped. **PhD can be a very lonely venture**.

I have also experienced more **xenophobia** this year, both before and after Brexit. There is also the uncertainty brought by the vote.
