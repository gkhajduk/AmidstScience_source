Soon after I decided to step up my blogging game (see my [previous post]({% post_url 2016-03-01-getting-phding-back-on-track %})) a few things happened, including a friend's blog on Blogger being deleted without any warning or explanation. All content gone forever.

This was the push I needed: I've been thinking about building my own website for a while. I wanted something a bit more professional and more customisable than Blogger, and I also liked the idea of learning a little bit of web development. I have been since developing this website - it turns out to be a bit harder than I expected, but also fun :]

Since I was migrating everything from my blog I decided to focus on getting the site up and running rather than on writing new posts. Hence the quietness - my apologies! I'm hoping to get back to blogging in the near future, but there are still plenty of sections to fill out on the website and things to tweak (e.g. post tags). I'm also collecting resources on the tools I use, so that you can  access those easily if you are interested (they will eventually make their way into the *Resources* tab).

Have a browse around and if you have a minute let me know what you think! I'd love some feedback. My email is at the bottom of the page or you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmidstScience).
