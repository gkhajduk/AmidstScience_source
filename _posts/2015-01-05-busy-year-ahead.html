I'm looking forward to this year, but it looks like it will be a fairly busy one. I'm away for at least a week every month till foreseeable future! Courses, demonstrating, conferences, workshops, fieldwork - you name it, I'm doing it.<br /><br />I'm excited, but also a bit apprehensive, as I've been struggling with my schedule a bit so far and this is likely to upset things. Hopefully I can figure out a way to deal with it.
