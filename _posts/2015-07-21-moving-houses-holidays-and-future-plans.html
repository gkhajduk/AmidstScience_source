This is a bit of a crazy time for me. I'm moving all my possessions from Scotland to England and I am amazed at how much stuff I own. There definitely needs to be a purging/give-away session soon.<br /><br />I'm also planning on taking some time off in August before flying out to Australia in September in order to do fieldwork (exciting!). I thought that since I wanted an extended holiday taking it between my first year confirmation and fieldwork was a good call. Hopefully it will cause little disruption to my work.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe my brain will get some much needed rest and will be ready to rock statistical modelling like never before. Here is hoping.&nbsp;
