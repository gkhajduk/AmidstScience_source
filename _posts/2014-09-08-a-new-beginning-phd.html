<div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I have started a PhD.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Starting a new job, in a new city, new apartment, new flatmates, new department, office, colleaguesâ€¦ Almost everything in my life suddenly changed and changed quite drastically.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is the sort of change that brings chaos, along with new challenges.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">In an attempt to deal with this change and protect certain important aspects of my life I started planning and organising (how I love organising!) ahead of time in an attempt to mitigate some of the unavoidable uncertainty that comes with such a Big Move. I'm organising everything, from my belongings, through computers, to streamlining the way I work and keep track of projects and tasks.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I'm curious to see how it will all work out and whether systems established ahead of the time will actually work out. How much have I managed to predict? How right (or wrong) was I about the type of life I will lead during my PhD?  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Who knows, maybe I will find that the steps I undertook made my life a thousand times easier. But then again, maybe after a month or two I will throw my hands in the air and start from scratch.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Time will show.</div>
