I think it's probably even more true for wild animals.<br /><br />It's not even that the little buggers are not doing what I want them to do, they are simply not doing much at all. During multiple focal watches absolutely nothing happens, the birds just forage and preen themselves.<br /><br />This means that data collection has been going rather slowly and I started to get a little bit stressed - what if I don't get enough data? I know it's not the end of the world, but I feel committed: I'm investing hours and hours of my time here (including on weekends) and feeling a little bit of pressure that I don't have much to show for it. I'm still learning a lot while I'm here, but something tangible would be nice, especially that this time would have been otherwise spend on results-producing analyses.<br /><br />I know that I can complete my PhD without these data... Yet, somehow, I know it will feel just a little bit like a failure if I don't get the data. The impostor syndrome is hiding just around the corner, pocking it's ugly head out.<br /><br /><br />Decision has been made - I'm going to extend my stay by a couple of weeks, till the end of October. Hopefully that will be enough. I shall find out I guess! Now onto flights re-booking and accommodation-searching.<br /><br /><br />To illustrate how slow and late everything in the field is - some of our males are still not through their moult!<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E87Pk28Pbmo/VhTI-u58QZI/AAAAAAAAAYY/T14IePemgNA/s1600/DSC05087.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="219" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E87Pk28Pbmo/VhTI-u58QZI/AAAAAAAAAYY/T14IePemgNA/s320/DSC05087.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Look at that scruffy face!</td></tr></tbody></table><br />
