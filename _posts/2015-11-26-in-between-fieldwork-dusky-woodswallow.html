Dusky Woodswallow (<i>Artamus cyanopterus</i>). I couldn't get much closer, but they spent ageeees preening each other and I got several very cute shots of this pair. If you think that they don't look quite right for a swallow you won't be surprised to read that they are actually more closely related to currawongs and Australian magpies than they are to swallows.<br /><br />I even managed to see a nest, bowl-shaped and made of twigs, tucked behind a bit of bark. No photos though as I didn't want to bother the birds.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gS9FXzzYVO0/Vj0I9V95asI/AAAAAAAAAuE/9Y4ysEnvjdI/s1600/DSC04794.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-gS9FXzzYVO0/Vj0I9V95asI/AAAAAAAAAuE/9Y4ysEnvjdI/s320/DSC04794.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />
