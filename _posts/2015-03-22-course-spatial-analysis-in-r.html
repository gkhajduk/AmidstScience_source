Course title: Spatial Analysis of Ecological Data in R, organised by PR~statistics.<br /><br />The course was really extensive. Each day we did at least one new "module". Have a look at their website for the list: <a href="http://prstatistics.co.uk/courses/spatial-analysis-in-R/index.html" target="_blank">Spatial analysis course.</a><br /><br />It was one of the hardest courses, if not <i>the</i> hardest one, I have ever done. By Wednesday afternoon I was nearly in tears. Frustration with R was taking over - the course material was really tough and pretty much all new to me and on top of that we had to write our R scripts from scratch. Which for me was as close to impossible as one can get. While I understood the concepts I really struggled to apply the knowledge effectively and work through assigned tasks, as my coding knowledge was letting me down. <br /><br />I have to admit, during the course I wasn't sure how much use it all would be, since I felt like I wasn't getting through enough of the practicals. However (and this is a big however!) during the last day we split into smaller groups and discussed our own data. I managed to get some feedback on my ideas and some tips about future analyses. It was really, really, <i>really</i> useful! In the end we were also given copies of all the code necessary to complete all the practical tasks. I really think that I should be able to go over things again in my own time and use everything I learned.<br /><br />This course ate more than half my yearly PhD-expenses budget, but I think it was worth it in the end and I would recommend it if you are interested in spatial analysis. Things would probably be easier if you know a bit of R (even better if you know <i>a lot of R</i>). If you don't know R, but you want to do it, be prepared for some really hard work and likely a bit of confusion and frustration too.<br /><br />There is something more this course reminded me of, which I think is really important: <b>if you struggle, talk to other people!</b> I can't stress this enough. So many others on the course struggled and knowing that made me feel less alone and less hopeless.
