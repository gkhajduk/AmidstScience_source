Varied sittella (<i>Daphoenositta</i> <i>chrysoptera</i>). Such a cool little fella! Three local birders and myself have sat down to have some food and we spotted this varied sittella and its nest. I'm happy I found the nest, it's rather well camouflaged. <br /><br />The sittella was going back and forwards, I'm pretty sure it was feeding chicks. It would fly onto the branch above the nest and then hop along (while being upside down) towards the nest. It also removed something from the nest, something white, I think it might have been a faecal sac.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xu0My93KwmY/Vj0K-ofF_ZI/AAAAAAAAAuk/xgxz0dC-W_0/s1600/DSC04834.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Xu0My93KwmY/Vj0K-ofF_ZI/AAAAAAAAAuk/xgxz0dC-W_0/s320/DSC04834.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />
