I have received an official report summarising my <i>viva</i>. It's nice to have it all on paper! <br /><b>&nbsp;</b><br />It sounds like I should have given more background during my talk and  made sure that I'm putting my analyses in context  ("presentation lacked  a bit of context").  I need to explain better where there are holes in our knowledge and  where the field is lacking data. I should point out how the questions  I'm asking and the analyses I'm carrying out fill in those gaps. Fair  enough! <br /><br />The report ends with<b> </b>a note that "the meeting was very successful and the committee has no hesitation" about me progressing :]&nbsp; Yay :]<br />
