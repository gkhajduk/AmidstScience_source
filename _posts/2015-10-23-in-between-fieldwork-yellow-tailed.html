Yellow-tails black cockatoos (<span class="st"><i>Calyptorhynchus</i> <i>funereus</i></span>) were my must-see in Australia. Those guys are absolutely stunning creatures! They seem quirky, fly beautifully and softly for such a big bird, have heaps and heaps of charm... Even their calls are lovely (which is fairly unusual for a parrot!).<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see them earlier in my trip with one of the local birders. Unfortunately, we accidentally spooked the birds, they flew across the river and even though we could still watch them from a distance I couldn't get decent photos.<br /><br />This was the only ok-ish one I got:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--mVWv8l5PeM/Vin-H2wINKI/AAAAAAAAAkg/nRf8DnfUuCg/s1600/DSC05046.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--mVWv8l5PeM/Vin-H2wINKI/AAAAAAAAAkg/nRf8DnfUuCg/s320/DSC05046.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />Since then I have been on a hunt for the yellow-tails. There is just something about them - seeing them once simply wasn't enough. Such beautiful birds. Despite the efforts and assistance from aforementioned birder I haven't managed to see them again. Until today.<br /><br />Yay! Finally today I have stumbled on a bigger flock and managed to get some photos. I've been bouncing of the walls with excitement the entire afternoon :]<br /><br />The conditions for taking photos weren't great, but I'm quite happy with what I got, especially considering that I'm leaving Australia soon and this was my last chance to see the yellow-tails on this trip.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wweMUVL2ZEI/Vin_skEolWI/AAAAAAAAAlA/oUx1ojrPLKI/s1600/DSC05887.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wweMUVL2ZEI/Vin_skEolWI/AAAAAAAAAlA/oUx1ojrPLKI/s320/DSC05887.jpg" width="279" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vmeNLb9jhro/Vin_nvyqjAI/AAAAAAAAAkw/2q10bXXfMGE/s1600/DSC05922.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vmeNLb9jhro/Vin_nvyqjAI/AAAAAAAAAkw/2q10bXXfMGE/s320/DSC05922.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B5ijdjfNkwE/Vin_7AVh2_I/AAAAAAAAAlI/Nxt10_790eA/s1600/DSC05953.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-B5ijdjfNkwE/Vin_7AVh2_I/AAAAAAAAAlI/Nxt10_790eA/s320/DSC05953.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2fu0ogx91_Y/VioF59AmYcI/AAAAAAAAAlU/blRj-F8_aww/s1600/DSC05944.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2fu0ogx91_Y/VioF59AmYcI/AAAAAAAAAlU/blRj-F8_aww/s320/DSC05944.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />More photos to come in the future :]<br /><br />
