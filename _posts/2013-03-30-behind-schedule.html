Last semester was pretty busy. It sounded like this semester is going to be easier - no group work, so studying should be easier to fit around work, a lot of coursework, but if one gets organised it all should be fine. If one gets really organised, one might even have some free time! All the reading I will be able to do...<br /><br />I planned and scheduled.<br /><br />Then I needed to prepare a project proposal for my masters year and started applying for funding to carry out a piece of research over the summer and got so stuck in in personal statements, CVs, drafts of proposals and applications that somehow I've 'lost' a month*.<br /><br />I was a month behind the schedule I prepared. So I prepared a new schedule. Currently I'm about two weeks behind that new schedule.<br /><br />Am I just unlucky with lots of things popping up here and there and eating up my time, schedule badly with not enough time or am I simply not organised enough to stick to the schedule? I guess it's probably a mix of the three - I didn't realise that project applications will take so much time, but then I could have probably squeezed a bit more work in-between lectures. I find it hard to do 10 different things one day though, I much prefer to have a big chunk of time to work on something and get it done, as it takes me a long time to <i>warm up. </i>Maybe that's the problem, maybe I need a different way of working. How does one go about re-wiring their brain though?<br /><br />All will get done in the end, no matter what. It always gets done and I work better under pressure.<br /><br />Maybe there is no point in planning and scheduling. Go back to general to-do-list instead of a schedule?&nbsp;Or maybe there is some secret way to schedule so that it's actually achievable to do everything according to the schedule?<br /><br />So to sum up, I'm attempting to find out what's the secret of perfect scheduling and how to re-wire my brain. There must be a way... I'm only going to get busier over the next few years and have to deal with it somehow!<br /><br /><br />*Will be really worth it if I get the funding and can do the project!<br /><br /><br />
