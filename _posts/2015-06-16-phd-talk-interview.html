I have done an interview for the great PhD Talk blog. If you don't know it, you should definitely check it out: Eva does a great job, there is sooooo much good advice over there. I really like all the guest posts too, it's nice to hear from a variety of people from different backgrounds and at different stages of their careers.<br /><br />I am a sucker for workflows and optimisation, so the new series of posts describing how different academics work was going to be a must-read for me. Eva was looking for more academics to take part in the series and I thought <i>why not?</i><br /><br />If you would like to read the interview you can find it here: <a href="http://phdtalk.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/i-am-gabriela-hajduk-and-this-is-how-i.html" target="_blank">This is how I work!</a>
