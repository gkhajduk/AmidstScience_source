Black-fronted dotterels (<i>Elseyornis</i> <i>melanops</i>) are not very common around Canberra and I only managed to see a pair during my visit.<br /><br />They were very easy too spook and didn't allow me to approach at all, every time I tried to take a step in their direction they would strut off hurriedly. They were moving around quite nervously and most of my photos came out rather blurry.<br /><br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lugEfspt3Wk/Vjzt82or5NI/AAAAAAAAAqo/evl4Z8mgKhk/s1600/DSC04892.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lugEfspt3Wk/Vjzt82or5NI/AAAAAAAAAqo/evl4Z8mgKhk/s320/DSC04892.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />
