<div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">This is the set up I've used during my undergrad/Masters and that I'm going to carry through onto the PhD.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I'm using a whole bunch of different tools to streamline my work and offload my brain - I have a goldfish memory (the castle around the corner is a surprise every time!*) and tend to worry about everything. All the time. I can't be very efficient without knowing that I can "forget" certain things because they have been recorded somewhere (and that I will get a reminder when the time comes).</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The ease of recording things, as well as the ability to access the information is paramount, as I work from several locations and need to be able to get my hands on all that data anytime, anywhere. I need a set up that will not only work between office and home, but also between 4 different countries on 2 different continents. Something that will work cross-platform, as I use both a tower PC and a MacBook, as well as an iPad and an Android phone.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I am currently using:</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">The Trio of <b>Skim</b>, <b>Scrivener </b>and <b>LaTeX </b>- <b>Skim </b>for reading and marking scientific papers, <b>Scrivener </b>for the bulk of my writing, including notes taken on the papers all the way to, hopefully, the Thesis. <b>LaTeX </b>is my secret weapon of choice when it comes to formatting, it's really second to none in this category.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br />See:&nbsp;<a href="http://amidstscience.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/scrivener-mendeley-latex-and-references.html" target="_blank">Scrivener + Mendeley + LaTeX and references</a><br /><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Mendeley </b>- for keeping track of my references. It produces a bibtex file that can be used with <b>LaTeX </b>to automatically input and format references, both in text and at the end of the document as a bibliography.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">For keeping track of most of my life I'm using <b>Calendars </b>(used to do Google, but swapped to iCloud now for no real reason), <b><a href="http://amidstscience.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/evernote.html" target="_blank">Evernote </a></b>and <b>Wunderlist</b>. Each of those plays a slightly different role, <b>Calendars </b>organise my day/week/month, <b>Evernote </b>collects things that might be of use one day (meeting and lecture notes, recipes, manuals, travel arrangements, blog ideasâ€¦), while <b>Wunderlist </b>is there, well, to keep track of my multiple to-do lists and my daily agenda.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><b>Mailbox </b>- I have also recently started using <b>Mailbox </b>on my iPad and Android in order to achieve "inbox zero". I wasn't sure I will likely, but <i>I'm totally digging it</i>.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I'm also using <b>Bloglovin</b>' and <b>Pocket </b>to read things that are not scientific papers. <b>Bloglovin</b>' keeps track of all blogs (I read mainly academia/science-related blogs). <b>Pocket </b>is the "I'll read it sometime later" bucket, where I throw stuff that might be interesting, but that I'm not sure I want to keep - if I do want to keep it, it will probably end up in <b>Evernote</b>.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I am still working on my cross-platform links, as an iPad is a fairly new addition to the family - I was lucky enough to win one in a contest and so haven't been building those systems with an iPad in mind. I am also attempting to use <b>IFTTT </b>to automate some processes, but I think I have a long way to go here.</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I am going to write a separate blog post on how I'm using each of the above, in case anyone out there is curious, but also so that I can see how my habits evolve over time. Once the posts are written I will link to them in this post (probably make the names of the programs clickable too).</div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">*I'm pretty sure I have heard this somewhere, but for the life of me can't remember where.  </span></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div>
