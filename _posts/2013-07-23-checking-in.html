I will update the blog shortly. I have been building my own PC and trying to get it up and running, but most importantly - organise it. This together with my research has been keeping me busy. I'm trying out Bloglovin' to see if I can keep track of some interesting blogs this way and I'm rewriting a couple of project report drafts today.<br /><br /><br />
