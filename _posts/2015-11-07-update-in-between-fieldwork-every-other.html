Me again. I have decided that for now <i>In-between fieldwork</i> posts with Australian wildlife will appear on Thursdays (completely arbitrary).<br /><br />I'm currently scheduling posts for every other Thursday to gauge how much material I have and will go from there - if there is lots left over I might bump it to a weekly Thursday post. Either way, if you are mainly interested in the photos hopefully this will make it easier for you to know when to pop back :]<br /><br /><br /><br />
