Yesterday I went to the Scottish Conference on Animal Behaviour (SCAB) at the University of St Andrews. It's still very early in my PhD and I was unsure whether I'd have enough for a good talk, so I decided to present a poster. I think it was a good call that allowed me to enjoy all the brilliant talks without feeling stressed.<br /><br />I enjoyed the day and was really impressed by everyone presenting. The talks included: use of landmarks in hummingbirds, information use and transit in nuthatches, cognition and nest building in birds, morphometrics of tools used by crows... And even observational learning in African Greys!*<br /><br /><br />My poster won the best poster prize** too! First poster presented at a conference :] Pretty chuffed :]<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">*parrot geek here</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">**chocolates.
