It's the beginning of a new year, which means blogs and websites are flooded with new years resolutions. I don't really believe in new years resolutions and most of the ones that I came across were pretty silly (e.g. jumping off of the highest diving board at a swimming pool). If there is one list that everyone should read it's this one:&nbsp;<a href="http://bellejar.ca/2015/01/02/resolutions-for-a-mentally-healthier-new-year/" target="_blank">Resolutions for a (Mentally) Healthier New Year</a>.<br /><br />I have a list. Not a list of resolutions, but a list of <i>reminders</i>.<br /><br />I try to reassess my life on a fairly regular basis, a few times a year. Splitting it up means I can keep an eye on whether I'm doing OK and making progress. If something is not working I can start over and try another way of achieving the same result. It also helps me to keep the balance when my circumstances change - for instance, everything has been turned on its head when I started the PhD. I moved, I got even busier than before and I am already experiencing the infamous two body problem. But I can still look at my list and remind myself what I want my life to be like.<br /><br />Anyhow, in the spirit of the new year I am going to post some of the things I have on the list.<br /><br /><br /><b>Climb regularly.</b> I need to fix my climbing schedule. I used to climb 2-3 times a week, but since the move in September I have been struggling to establish a proper climbing routine, so this needs correcting. I would like to climb at least once per week. Part of the problem is how far the wall is from my house/work.<br /><br /><b>Exercise regularly. </b>This normally gets covered by climbing. Since distance is making it harder to climb I'm thinking of including some other activity - fitness classes, maybe pilates? I made plans to try a weekly "Body Balance" class with a friend.<br /><br /><b>Draw. </b>When I was young I used to draw and paint quite a bit. I was never amazing at it, but it's one of those activities that can take your mind off of everything else. A while back I bought a graphics tablet and tried drawing/painting digitally (emulating natural media) in an attempt to get back into it but without the need to buy and store supplies (and without the mess too!). I need to work it into my schedule again.<br /><br /><b>Read (for pleasure).</b>&nbsp;I used to read all the time. All the time. Not so much recently, at least not things unrelated to my work - I need to fix that! I love fiction and it would be a good break from biology-related reading. I am hugely impressed by&nbsp;<a href="http://phdtalk.blogspot.co.uk/2014/12/evaluation-of-my-goals-for-2014.html" target="_blank">what Eva achieved in 2014</a>. She read over 90 books last year!<br /><br /><b>Socialise.</b> I'm not naturally the most social person, I am perfectly happy by myself drawing, reading or going for a walk. Seeing that I have moved and know hardly anyone over here I am trying to make an effort and make some friends.<br /><br /><b>Meal plan.</b> I used to do some meal planning with my partner and it worked really well, making shopping and cooking a lot easier and helping to reduce waste. Since I moved and started commuting regularly to see my partner my cooking has been rather <i>ad hoc</i>, as I don't spend all nights at my flat.<br /><br /><b>Culture. </b>I want to take advantage of where I live - I'll make a list of things that need to be done in the city and start ticking them off.<br /><br /><b>Meditation. </b>Try it. People seem to keep talking about it. Who knows, maybe I'll like it.<br /><br /><b>Cooking &amp; Baking.</b> Schedule time for some culinary fun. Maybe even sign up for a course to learn something new? Baking was my go-to de-stresser during undergrad exams. I always joked that opening a bakery was my Plan B. I want to get back into it; cookies and breads, here I come.<br /><br /><b>Blogging.</b> I have been failing miserably at regular blogging and Twitter. I want to get back to it. I probably have to schedule it in or it won't happen.<br /><br /><br />I think it's pretty obvious that the main challenge since I started my PhD is time; some things don't happen as easily and naturally as they used to. I will have to actually schedule "me time" and relaxing activities in order to make sure that I keep at them instead of getting sucked into the vortex of pointless procrastination and hermit life. I will come up with strategies and actionable ways of achieving all of the above and staying on track. I will set little goals and review them regularly - weekly and monthly.<br /><br /><br /><br />Work related plans?<br /><br /><b>Shut up &amp; Write sessions!</b>&nbsp;There are none in my department as far as I can tell, so I want to set up some. Hopefully I can find some folk who will be interested :] I also want to play some more with different types of working schedules.<br /><br />
