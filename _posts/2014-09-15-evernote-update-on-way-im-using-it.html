<div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I am taking some taught courses and have decided to create a separate notebook called <b>Courses</b>. I initially put notes on the courses in the <b>Meetings</b>&nbsp;notebook, but for some reason it didn't sit well with me, it felt like those notes didn't belong in <b>Meetings</b>.  </div><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><br /></div><br /><div style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I might also get rid off <b>PhD Concepts &amp; Definitions, Ideas &amp; Notes</b> notebook - I have created a document in Scrivener that keeps the definitions important for my PhD, so most of the basic things went there. This notebooks currently contains notes about my ideas linked to organisation of certain project, but I wonder whether those couldn't live in another notebook (e.g. <b>PhD Advice &amp; Resources</b> or<b> Lab Journal</b>). I will see what happens, if it doesn't get much use it will need to go.</div>
