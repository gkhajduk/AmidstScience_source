Turns out that it's actually harder to quantify my work achievements than it is to reflect on the [personal side of things]({% post_url 2017-01-03-looking-back-personal %}).

### In and around the office

- I did **a bunch of analysis**, which hopefully should allow me to produce **3 manuscripts/chapters**.
- **I wrote a manuscript**.
- I have **reached nearly 123 k words written** in Scrivener since the beginning of my PhD. This is all PhD related, although I used to take notes in Evernote too and it doesn't include any of my R scripts and reports, so it's not super accurate... But still a measure of progress.
- **I passed my second year review** without problems.
- I have kept a pretty much **paper free office**.

### Out of the office

- **I presented at an international conference** & it went well! I got good questions and lots of people came to talk to me afterwards (I have written a post about the conference, but it's still sitting in the draft folder... I'll pop a link here later).
- I gave **2 talks** and **lead 2 group meetings** within the department. **I also gave a talk at ANU** when I visited during my field season.
- **I attended a one-day WISE event** and partook in some interesting discussions.
- **I completed the second and last field season of my PhD.** Your complimentary superb fairy-wren photo can be found below.
- **I did part of my Professional Internship Programme (PIP).** I did some work in a seed bank, archived cryptogam project and did seed imaging (you can find some of the images from that project [here](http://www.anbg.gov.au/photo/search-all-plant-short.html
)). All done within ANBG, it was great to gain more insight into what they do there.
- **I taught on 2 fieldcourses:** Field Zoology and Field Ecology.
- **I presented a poster, which got highly commended**, at our GradSchool conference.
- **I took part in a workshop on jobs post-PhD.** It was a very informative workshop and we got lots of great tips about networking. Those allowed me to **successfully network at a conference** - yay!

### Oddball items

- I have discovered [#ChronicallyAcademic](https://twitter.com/chron_ac) on Twitter and I am grateful to know that the community is there.

### Low Points

A lot of my PhD work focused on rewriting a manuscript and exploring a number of avenues for the analyses. I have made quite a bit of progress, but I need to put finishing touches on majority of it before it can be considered "complete". **Often it felt like I was running around in circles and not getting anywhere.**

New PhD students join the department when I'm away on fieldwork and so I miss out on meeting people and establishing new connections. What is even worse, **most of the people I know in the department have left or are about to leave.**
 
I still haven't sorted issues with my demonstrating earnings getting **unfairly taxed**. It's been very frustrating to be shrugged off constantly.
