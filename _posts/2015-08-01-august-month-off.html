In the name of work-life balance, batteries-recharging, mental health and fun my partner and I are taking the entire month of August off and going on a little adventure :]<br /><br />As I haven't really had the time to plan the entire holiday in detail, I tried to sort out some nice stop over places for the first few days to break up the drive&nbsp; and we can go from there.<br /><br />So the general plan is to drive down through France, stopping at Foret d'Orient to enjoy the wildlife, then driving on to Domaine de la Dombes where we can have a look around multiple lakes and visit Parc des Oiseaux. From then we can drive onto Italy, probably stopping somewhere on the way. We will spend some time in Liguria, doing a bit of walking, rock climbing and visiting the coast. I'm quite excited about Italian food too! Once we had a bit of a rest we shall move on and drive further into Italy, ending up in Dolomites where we can do more climbing.<br /><br />We leave today! See you later :]
