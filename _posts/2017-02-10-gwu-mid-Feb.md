My talk abstract was **accepted for ESEB 2017!** Yay! Get ready for some superb fairy-wrens bizarreness :]

#### What have I been up to over the past few weeks?

- The main focus of the past few weeks was on the **content** of the first PhD manuscript/chapter. This involved a bit of back and forward between myself and my supervisors, **discussing and tweaking the models** and deciding on what will be in the main body of the manuscript and what should go into the supplementary. I think we are almost there now! The figures are proving a bit trickier to make than anticipated, but hopefully I can figure things out soon. 

- I started **demonstrating on the Behavioural Ecology**. So far I've done sessions on stats, understanding analysis output and writing it up, as well as scientific paper discussion and presentation. 
- I'm keeping up **reading papers** [#SFWpapers](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23SFWpapers&src=typd) **and** [#230papers](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23230papers&src=typd) - although I am **behind** the mark to be perfectly honest!
- I'm **tweeting about fairy-wrens under** [#SFWtidbit](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23SFWtidbit&src=typd). I now **figured out how to schedule tweets** so I will sit down and sort out the next few weeks to make sure there is a steady supply of tidbits :] 


I've done tons of work and I think I'm making progress, even if it is slow and feels like pulling teeth at times. But the past month and a half have been **really tough** - vicious circle of not sleeping, stress and escalating chronic pain levels made life difficult.
