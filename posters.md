Take time to plan your poster. Figure out what you want to show before starting to make the actual poster - it's easy to spent hours and hours tweaking something and still end up with a confusing and poor poster. Resist the urge to dive straight into the software.

## First: THINK

What is the take home message? Do know what are the main data/outcomes you are going to show? 

Once you have your take home message gather the main elements that you want to display to get it across - I tend to start with photos, figures and 2-3 statements. Those are the core of my poster, everything else revolves around them.

Before you go any further ask yourself - do all those elements form a cohesive entity? Do they all go together and are they all necessary to get your message across? 

## Second: MAIN RULES

Design is a fairly individual thing, what appeals to one person won't necessarily appeal to everyone... Yet, there are some basic rules that will help you succeed:
- Poster needs to be visually striking, it needs to be eye-catching and appealing. That's how you draw your audience in.
- It needs to be simple. Make it. Simplify. Assess. Simplify. Don't clutter.
- It needs to be clean - remove all unnecessary data; there is no need to show the same thing in three different ways.
- Make all elements (text, graphs, photos, diagrams...) large & bold.
- Try your best to include elements that are as self-explanatory as possible. It will help you to...
- Keep text to the minimum. 
- QUALITY over QUANTITY.
- Check whether there are any guidelines given for this specific poster - often the poster needs to be a specific size (usually A0) and orientation (usually portrait).
- Consider who is your target audience: kids? general public? degree-level science students? peers? specialists in your field?

You probably read the above list and thought *duh, obviously, but **how** do I do that?* - not to worry. Some actionable tips are below.

### Figures and Photographs
Less is more and the larger the better.

Any labels (e.g. figure axes) and arrows have to be bold and easily readable. 

Generally, standard figures which would be appropriate for a manuscript are not appropriate for a poster - at the least the labels have to be re-done. Don't just copy and paste your figure.

I try to also use the colours in my figures strategically - they are part of the bigger picture. Literally. I often use complimentary colours in the figures and make sure that they work well with my chosen background.

### Title
It has to be large and readable from about 5 m away. Make sure you try it before printing your poster - make it 100% on your screen and step away. You won't be able to fit the entire title on an average computer screen, but you will be able to judge the size of the letters much better this way.

TIP: Another way to do this is to sneakily use a projector in your department (if possible) and project your poster at its true size to check everything works at that scale.
