- presented at an international conference & it went well! I got good questions and lots of people came to talk to me afterwards (maybe just link to a more detailed post about ISBE? - BBC NHU, Walt?)
- seminars - Happy Hour talk, Life-history, WEG, Beetles 
- completed my second and last field season
- did part of my PIPs - gained an insight into the work at the Gardens
- taught on Field Zoology and Field Ecology
- GradSchool conference - poster highly commended
- attended WISE event
- passed my second year review without problems
- did a bunch of analysis, which hopefully should produce 3 papers
- wrote a manuscript
- how many words have I written in Scrivener?
- networking at ISBE
- workshop on jobs post PhD
- I have kept a pretty much **paper free office**.

### Oddball items

- I have discovered [#ChronicallyAcademic](https://twitter.com/chron_ac) on Twitter and I am grateful to know that the community is there. If you are an academic with a disability and/or a chronic condition check their [site](https://chronicallyacademic.org/index.php/en/) out. If you are not, check it out too.

### Low Points
- reworking the same ideas multiple times
- seeing most of the people I know in the department leave 
- I still haven't sorted issues with my demonstrating earnings getting taxed. It's been very frustrating to be shrugged off for another year.
