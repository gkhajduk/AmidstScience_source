This post is part of a [Fieldwork Tips]({% post_url 2016-09-26-fieldwork-tips-series %}) series.


. Choose your fieldsite wisely (if you can!)
- weather
- remotness
- stability (political)
- prone to natural disasters?
- gender norms
- emotional toll
- spoken language (learn if you can)
- you might like the idea of remote fieldwork... But you might not - for many the best choice is picking a fieldsite close to their university/hometown
- try to pick a project that doesn't rely on multiple years of data collection
- learn a bit about where you are going, ask someone who visited (but is not a local!) about any quorks they discovered. The reason for not asking a local is that they might not realise things normal to them are new to you e.g. in some places you can't flush toilet paper down the toilet.
- don't just focus on the place, especially if you are a field assistant - who you work with is extremely important! Be prepared to spend a lot of time with your co-workers. The more remote the fieldsite, the more time you will spend with them.
