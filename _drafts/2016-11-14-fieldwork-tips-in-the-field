### From a woman ecologist & climber: a few tips on hygiene in the field

Guys, give this a read too. There might be things here you have never considered before and the knowledge might come in handy one day. Obviously some things are the same regardless of sex, e.g. whatever you do *leave no trace*. But here are some extra tips for people with vaginas.

- menstruation
- peeing
- contraception
- keeping clean

- shaving

"My wife and daughter if needing privacy, would wear skirts (or pull out a wrap around) that would cover most skin on a squat.  Also if skillfully done, no body would be the wiser to what was going on."

"When we are going to be on the trail overnight, I carry an interior tent wall(it came with a multi-room discount store tent).  They weigh almost nothing and can be hung or draped as a privacy screen. "

"You might want to add a plastic trowel to your list, even if you kick a hole/ use a rock yourself, others may prefer to dig a hole.
Having a tent which pitches outer first, with the floor rolling back, is good for people who don't like washing outdoors without tree cover or where the weather is crazy. If it is muddy, use your foam sit mats to squat on. Cut a piece from a packtowel to make a lightweight hand flannel."

"Bring extra stove gas, so you can warm water for her washing needs.  A sense of feeling clean can be a huge deal to women, but cold water can be a huge barrier to some; the additional fuel weight precludes most of this issue.  Daily clean undies and socks also goes a long way; bring enough or accept on trail washing will be part of the activities.  Castle soap or other bio degradable products can be used for all you cleaning needs."
