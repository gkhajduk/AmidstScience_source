. Go paperless!
- laptop, tablet/phone, e-reader are your friends... But do make sure you have a good back up strategy in place!
- "Use a digital camera to take photos of newspaper articles and other documents; it is quicker and it takes up less suitcase space than cuttings or photocopies."
- you can generate random numbers with a phone and keep several guidebook apps to hand too, without having to lug around hefty books
- never rely on technology though... A battery bank and a waterproof case/bag are a must
