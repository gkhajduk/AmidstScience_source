. Packing list


- socks, socks, socks, socks... preferably all dark, as light colours will end up looking disgusting. For all my sock needs I go black.
- colours of your clothing might matter - a lot of my outdoor clothing is climbing oriented (and we Europeans like our climbing attire to be happy, bright & colorful - enter my lime green trousers + bright red waterproof combo), so not all of it would be great for work with birds

- I'm a fan of technical clothing - it wicks away moisture better than cotton and dries quicker (great for wearing in hotter weather, but also you can hand wash items and don't have to bring tons of shirts). It also tends to be more odour resistant, which is great, as you will inevitably wear the same thing more than once.
- " waterproof rain jacket, an outfit to wear around civilization"

- "A computer charger with attachments that let you plug into car lighters and airplane seats (yes, airplane seats have outlets–you just need the right thingamajig).
An unlocked cell phone with the simplest (read: least battery consuming) LCD display. I’ve used a cheapo Nokia for years. (I might upgrade, however, to something that gets e-mail. Data plans are CHEAP in Liberia.)"
