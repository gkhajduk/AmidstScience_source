. Make sure to take time off and enjoy it
- explore
- rest and relax
- be open to invitations
- try the local food
- "It can be exhausting: long days, a hot climate, different food etc. This can make it hard to find the energy to write up field notes, transcribe tapes, or keep your research diary in the evenings. Be realistic about what you can manage in your schedule, and give yourself breaks."
- "The first month can be difficult. You may be lonely, unused to the culture and climate, and unsure how your research will proceed. Social clubs (such as the Hash House Harriers) can be an excellent source of friends and connections, for finding accommodation etc."
- music is good to have
- yoga and meditation can be useful too

. Speak up
- if you feel unsafe at any point - no data is worth risking your well being for
- if you are overtired. Fieldwork can be very tiring and different people have different levels of resistance. I've worked with people before who seemed to be superhuman, but it's ok to say you need a few extra hours of sleep!
