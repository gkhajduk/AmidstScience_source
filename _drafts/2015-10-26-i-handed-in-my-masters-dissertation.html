I handed in my masters dissertation last week and decided to take a part of afternoon off to organise things and catch a breath. I watched a few random things including an episode of&nbsp; The Big Bang Theory in which Amy feels excluded and uses the line "one of those things is not like the others"*.<br /><br />It made me think. I love research, I want to do a PhD and stay in academia. My closest family has always been really supportive. <i>But</i>. I'm the first one to make it to university in my family. More than that, I don't want to have a <i>normal </i>job like a <i>normal</i> person should. I know my parents are proud of me, but they haven't been able to help me navigate college and university, or any other aspect of my life abroad (and I moved away age 16). I find it sad that I can't fully share with them what I'm doing, why I'm doing it and why I love it. The fact that I'm currently working on sperm doesn't help the matter. I think that they are happy for me, but when I call excited about an aspect of my project the topic always gets changed straight away. To strawberries, or to someone who I used to know getting married. <br /><br /><br />all my friends from middle and high school are getting married, settled and having babies. Some of them live with their parents or have houses handed down to them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*I think that it comes from the Sesame Street, but since I never watched Sesame Street in English I wouldn't really know.<br /><div style="background-color: white; border: medium none; color: black; overflow: hidden; text-align: left; text-decoration: none;"><a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-others-lyrics-sesame-street.html#ixzz2rXXfcLrT" style="color: #003399;"></a> </div>
